                                                        <p>Word offers two ways to save a file: Save and Save As. These options work in similar ways, with a few important differences.</p>
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li><b>Save:</b> When you create or edit a document, you'll use the Save command to save your changes. You'll use this command most of the time. When you save a file, you'll only need to choose a file name and location the first time. After that, you can click the Save command to save it with the same name and location.</li>
                                                            <li><b>Save As:</b> You'll use this command to create a copy of a document while keeping the original. When you use Save As, you'll need to choose a different name and/or location for the copied version.</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                        <h2>About OneDrive</h2>
                                                        <p>Most features in Microsoft Office, including Word, are geared toward saving and sharing documents online. This is done with OneDrive, which is an online storage space for your documents and files. If you want to use OneDrive, make sure you’re signed in to Word with your Microsoft account. Review our lesson on Understanding OneDrive to learn more.</p>
                                                        <h2>To save a document:</h2>
                                                        <p>It's important to save your document whenever you start a new project or make changes to an existing one. Saving early and often can prevent your work from being lost. You'll also need to pay close attention to where you save the document so it will be easy to find later.</p>

                                                        <p>If you want to save a different version of a document while keeping the original, you can create a copy. For example, if you have a file named Sales Report, you could save it as Sales Report 2 so you'll be able to edit the new file and still refer back to the original version.</p>
                                                        <p>To do this, you'll click the Save As command in Backstage view. Just like when saving a file for the first time, you'll need to choose where to save the file and give it a new file name.</p>
